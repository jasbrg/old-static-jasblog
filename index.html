This is getting pretty interesting. The spreadsheet functionality of org-tables
is more impressive than I would have guessed. For small example here's a
snapshot of a <code>diet.org</code> file I've been working on.
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Food Lookup Table
#+TBLNAME: nutrition
| name           | cal/g | fat%g | carb%g | prot%g |
|----------------+-------+-------+--------+--------|
| corn beef hash |  1.64 |    10 |     10 |      7 |
</pre>


<pre class="example">
* Food Log
#+TBLNAME: diet
| timestamp              | name           | grams | cal/g | calories |
|------------------------+----------------+-------+-------+----------|
| [2021-01-15 Fri 13:35] | corn beef hash |   198 |  1.64 |   324.72 |
#+TBLFM: $4='(org-lookup-first $2 '(remote(nutrition, @2$1..@&gt;$1)) '(remote(nutrition, @2$2..@&gt;$2)))::$5=$4*$3
</pre>


<p>
Put the point on the last line, <code>C-c C-c</code>, and ta-da!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge1c214d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge1c214d"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Capture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I'm lazy, so remembering how to record things is a bit more work than I want to
do regularly, especially since I know I don't have to with <code>org-capture</code>. I've
been having some fun with it lately as I've started using <code>org-roam</code> which has
an extension to the already featureful <code>org-capture</code>. Here I want to capture two
different things
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Nutrition of a food</li>
<li>Amount of foot eaten</li>
</ol>
<p>
With the functionality of org tables I know I can do some computations very
easily with the information entered so that's the kind of capture I'll use.
After staring at the documentation of <code>org-capture-templates</code> for a while I
arrive at
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list
 'org-capture-templates
 '((<span class="org-string">"f"</span> <span class="org-string">"Food Log"</span> table-line (file+headline <span class="org-string">"~/org/log.org"</span> <span class="org-string">"Food Log"</span>)
    <span class="org-string">"| %U | %^{name} | %^{grams} | | |"</span>
    <span class="org-builtin">:prepend</span> t <span class="org-builtin">:immediate-finish</span> t
    )
   (<span class="org-string">"F"</span> <span class="org-string">"Food Nutrients"</span> table-line (file+headline <span class="org-string">"~/org/log.org"</span> <span class="org-string">"Food Nutrients"</span>)
    <span class="org-string">"| %^{name} | %^{cal/g} | %^{fat%g} | %^{carb%g} | %^{prot%g} | "</span>
    <span class="org-builtin">:prepend</span> t <span class="org-builtin">:immediate-finish</span> t
    )))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Reviewing, we have a list <code>org-capture-templates</code> which contains a list that
defines the capture behavior. Check out the documentation of that variable for a
full explanation. The spec of the sublists is:
</p>

<p>
<code>(key description type target template . properties)</code>
</p>

<p>
The first two are obvious, they configure the interface for this template from
the <code>org-capture</code> dispatch<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. The type I use is <code>table-line</code>, which searches
for the first table at its <code>target</code>. We can configure the location within the
table with the <code>:table-line-pos</code> property, but instead I format the tables to
please the expected defaults, which (per capture-template) is a single table
with static column names. This lends itself to a quick-entry-quit cycle defined
with the <code>:immediate-finish</code> property combined with prompts for all necessary
data. I <code>:prepend</code> mostly stylistically, it's nicer to read <i>IMHO</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org73277f0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org73277f0"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Getting deeper</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This seems to work out well as a quick method for recording diet. Everything is
normalized around grams and cal<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> because that's the most straightforward
way. Nutritional science is a mystery to me, but I believe tracking
macronutrients should suffice for the level of insight I can make. Micronutrient
tracking can be done in parallel and in more of a goal based method, rather than
logging. At some point in future I could do something like the nutrition lookup
table demonstrated above, or something else&#x2026; not even sure what ought be
tracked. 
</p>

<p>
What I would like to do next is make a third table which is calculated based off
of the first two, which displays the sum of calories consumed in a day along
with the relative proportion per macronutrient. My first thought is the lookup
would be complicated by the presence of time in the diet table timestamp. So
remove that for now&#x2026;<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> In fact that'll be the target, just the sum of
calories in a day. The information about proportion can be done in a separate
formula, and should prove to be much more complex. Initially online I find <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/61391/org-mode-sum-time-from-remote-table-with-org-lookup-all">this
page</a> which is instructive.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, with a little hacking I have a working example, although it's a bit more
invloved than desired. We'll get to that later.
</p>

<p>
I add a filter one the first columnt of the diet table
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var x=diet[1:-1]
(delete-dups (mapcar (lambda (y) (list (car y))) x))
#+end_src
</pre>


<p>
Which provides me with the deduplicated list of dates.
</p>

<pre class="example">
| [2021-01-15 Fri] |
</pre>


<p>
Name this, and sprinkle in some <code>org-table</code> magic.
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+TBLNAME: dietdaily
| timestamp        |          calories |
|------------------+-------------------|
| [2021-01-15 Fri] | 626.5400000000001 |
#+TBLFM: $2='(apply '+ (mapcar 'string-to-number (org-lookup-all $1 '(remote(diet,@2$1..@&gt;$1)) '(remote(diet,@2$5..@&gt;$5)))))
</pre>


<p>
Perfect! Well, actually this is way more involved than I want. I want to point
at a block and say "Do this!" and see it be done. Luckily these are fore-blazed
trails. Some people must use these spreadsheet feature a lot! They went and
wrote <a href="https://github.com/tbanel/orgaggregate">this</a> to generate tables from your tables. It is much better&#x2026; with just
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+begin: aggregate :table diet :cols "timestamp vsum(calories)"
#+end
</pre>


<p>
<b><i>C-c C-c</i></b>
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+begin: aggregate :table diet :cols "timestamp vsum(calories)"
| timestamp        | vsum(calories) |
|------------------+----------------|
| [2021-01-15 Fri] |         626.54 |
#+end
</pre>


<p>
Nice! No floating point fudgery. (You'll notice I added some more items to
<code>diet</code> for a sum). Representing the proportion of macronutrients will have to
wait for now, dinner's cooking and I still have to see how well this page
publishes!

Coming to you from <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">nearly-nine-hundred lines</a> of Emacs-lisp and a <a href="https://sandyuraz.com/styles/org.min.css">pittance</a> of
CSS. Do you really need more? <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> In time I'll accumulate more bits and
pieces of customization and configuration to apply, better expressing myself
through this site. As it stands now this little veneer suffices, it's never
really about what's on the cover anyway, but how effective the cover is at
appealing to those that may appreciate the content. As long as you can make out
the shapes of these letters in the order I have lain them out and we can speak
alike, you have some chance of catching my drift.
</p>

<p>
More interesting to me, than <code>family=Inconsolata</code>, is the set of pipes and gears
that thrum and turn making manifest those thoughts cannily caught, cast into
concrete from what was once ineffable as birdsong's last reflection on a sun
bleached birch tree. The fleeting formation neurons firing a whispering voice to
an inner ear which hands can transcribe, digits to digits. Ten to two (that
is one and zero) and back again, if this bird's song is sweet enough to echo off
the bark of your mind.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has long been my preferred editor, OS, and church. It's just a damn fine
piece of software.

There isn't much like it, comparisons to other editors are usually misguided
because it isn't anything like other editors. An old joke is Emacs is a good OS,
it just lacks a good text editor. A slightly younger joke is, that's true but we
can emulate VI now. Really it's a text programming environment
