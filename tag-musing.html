<p>
Today I went on a little bit of a rabbit hole when configuring my RSS feeds to
please <code>elfeed-org</code>. Its configuration is simple enough, a normal org file where
the headings are feed URLs for <code>elfeed</code>, and the tags are tags and inherited
normally. Also, org-links are valid and understood. Cool!
</p>

<p>
Then I tried fitting YouTube channels into this routine, but that wasn't quite
as trivial. After some experimentation with scripts and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklets</a> the
solution I ended up using was to just find and copy the relevant URL
programmatically with a <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/36357-youtube-copy-channel-rss-feed-url-to-clipboard">user-script</a> called through <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a>. It needed a
small modification, adding
</p>

<p>
<code>// @match        https://www.youtube.com/c/*</code>
</p>

<p>
to include the apparantly new shortened URLs, there may be more edge cases
lurking.
</p>

<p>
Then, I have a couple of entries added to <code>org-capture-templates</code> the usual way<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list
 'org-capture-templates
 '("r" "RSS Feed" entry (file+headline "~/org/feeds.org" "Inbox")
   "*** %^C"
   :prepend t :immediate-finish t))

(add-to-list
 'org-capture-templates
 '("y" "YouTube Feed" entry (file+headline "~/org/feeds.org" "YouTube")
   "**** [[%x][%^{Channel Name}]]"
   :prepend t :immediate-finish t))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ta-da! Done for now, I'm satisfied. Though I can foresee the obvious extension
of integrating (the lately hotly contested) <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>. Maybe there's already
some extension? hmm, at least not on <code>melpa</code> or <code>gnu</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Envision it so: a tag is specified in some way, when the specified tag is added
to a post (through <code>elfeed</code>), it is marked for download into a specified
directory. There, I've defined a new Emacs package! :)
</p>

<p>
There is already an Emacs interface to youtube-dl, <a href="https://gitlab.com/tuedachu/ytdl">ytdl</a>. If this, we'll call it
<code>elfeed-ytdl</code>, has the two packages as a dependency the actual code to achieve
this functionality is probably under fifty lines. Perhaps!

<a href="http://www.orgzly.com/">Orgzly</a> is nice, very nice. The interface is pretty impressive for capturing as
much of Org Mode's functionality as it does, but it's more than I quite need or
want especially because I'm using a <a href="https://www.unihertz.com/jelly-2.html">Jelly 2</a>, which has a screen under 4" so
inputing great volumes of text is somewhat prohibitive. Still, I want to
interface with Org Mode from my phone despite its small size so instead of a
full featured implementation of Org Mode on Android I simply want the Org
Capture interface. The ability to program~configure~customize templates for
inputing some data, and quickly stashing it away is desirable and suitable for
the limiting form factor of a small phone. Find more information about the
<code>org-capture</code> templates <a href="org-capture-templates">here</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
There appears to be some integration thought of for a mobile
protocol <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-Mobile.html">here</a> but I can't tell if this has been abandoned since. I recall a
"Mobile Org" app at some point but it has been superseded by Orgzy.

An Org Babel interface. Querying WolframAlpha from Org-mode is potentially
useful for a computational notebook, fluently accessing the data available in
either textual, image, or mathematica formats. The last being useful with
<code>ob-mathematica</code>. Inspired by <code>ob-rest</code> for its design.

<p>
Part of my resolutions for the new year is to blog as often as possible, which
would have felt rather indulgent and narcissistic when I was older, but I'm
younger than that now. The word itself I find unattractive, the 'b' bursting
from pursed lips, the 'l' scraping past hard palate, the 'o' filling the mouth
with its round sound conjuring a glottal 'g'. It's charming though, in its
clumsiness. Originating from "web log" from when the internet was young and the
uses of the medium were less usual, more strange. Regardless of the history of
blogging it is today a useful source of technical information, as the people who
generally still have blogs are technical people. Laymen have services and
platforms with lower barrier to entry and maintenance, though this usually
entails being as the product bought and sold. Not very condusive to privacy,
security, or sanity to have quantifications of your essential nature bundled up
and sold en masse to the highest bidder aiming for your demo.
</p>

<p>
Blogging in comparison is much more wholesome so I'm not as concerned with my
potential narcissism for running one. To me at this moment keeping this blog is
a way to require something of myself which is presentable, so at least the
potential for an audience is necessary to motivate myself into keeping to that.
This comes at time when general precautionary measures are in effect so as to
avoid infection by disease, meaning contact with other people is rather scarce.
We're a social creature, humans. If you doubt this to any degree, just look to
the punitive system where solitary confinement is among the harshest punishments
that can be levied. We simply require contact, there is no two-ways about it.
The Hermit may momentarily escape the trappings of civilization in the
mountains, but the only way for his solitude to have meaning is for it to
eventually end.
